Detection
GB: $88,$33,$0F,$00,$00,$00,$0F,$00 (Command $0F, no data)
Printer : $81 $00 (status)

Command 1: initialize
Command 2: Start Printing
Data length: 4 bytes

Byte 1: Number of sheets to print (0-255). 0 means line feed only.
Byte 2: Margins, high nibble is the feed before printing, low nibble is after printing. GB Camera sends $13 by default.
Byte 3: Palette, typically $E4 (0b11100100)
Byte 4: 7 bits exposure value, sets the burning time for the print head. GB Camera sends $40 by default. Official manual mentions -25% darkness for $00 and +25% for $7F.

Command $F: Read status

Printer
Status byte
Bit 7	Low Battery	Set when the voltage is below threshold
Bit 6	Other error
Bit 5	Paper jam	Set when the encoder gives no pulses when the motor is powered
Bit 4	Packet error
Bit 3	Unprocessed data	Set when there's unprocessed data in memory - AKA ready to print
Bit 2	Image data full
Bit 1	Currently printing	Set as long as the printer's burnin' paper
Bit 0	Checksum error	Set when the calculated checksum doesn't match the received one

Example
Send command 1, the answer should be $81, $00
Send command 4 with $280 of your graphics, the answer should still be $81, $00
Ask for status with command $F, the answer should now be $81, $08 (ready to print)
Send an empty command 4 packet, the answer should still be $81, $08
Send command 2 with your arguments (margins, palette, exposure), the answer should still be $81, $08
Ask for status with command $F until it changes to $81, $06 (printing !)
Ask for status with command $F until it changes to $81, $04 (printing done)
Optionally send 16 zero bytes to clear the printer's receive buffer (GB Camera does it)
